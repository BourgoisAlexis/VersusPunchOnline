# VersusPunch Online
VersusPunch was originaly created with some friends of mine during a game jam a few years ago (2019).
The idea behind this project is to remake this game we really liked to create and make it so that it can be played online.

## Peer to peer
This is pretty much the first time i implemented peer to peer in a game working in Unity. Even though this is probably not a perfect implementation i'm happy with the result at this point.

## Rollback netcode
Not fully implemented yet i'm still working on it to resolve some issues i encountered

## CustomPhysics
I had the ambition to implement custom physics to have the possibility to create a deterministic physics since Unity's physics is not.
After a few researches i implemented a simple 2D box physics based on FixedPoint variables.
*see DPhysx scripts*
